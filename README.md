# hello-world
My first hello world in GitHub

Hi there! Rech here. I'm in a point in my life where I'm leaving my first company and move to a new one. And I'm so nervous about it but excited at the same time. I only know a little of C# and now I have to learn a lot of things and do advance reading so I can easily cope up with my new work.
